        Urban flooding in a street in Morpeth, England
        A flood is an overflow of water (or rarely other fluids) that submerges land that is usually dry.[1] In the sense of "flowing water", the word may also be applied to the inflow of the tide. Floods are of significant concern in agriculture, civil engineering and public health. Human changes to the environment often increase the intensity and frequency of flooding. Examples for human changes are land use changes such as deforestation and removal of wetlands, changes in waterway course or flood controls such as with levees. Global environmental issues also influence causes of floods, namely climate change which causes an intensification of the water cycle and sea level rise.[2]: 1517  For example, climate change makes extreme weather events more frequent and stronger.[3] This leads to more intense floods and increased flood risk.[4][5]

        Natural types of floods include river flooding, groundwater flooding coastal flooding and urban flooding sometimes known as flash flooding. Tidal flooding may include elements of both river and coastal flooding processes in estuary areas. There is also the intentional flooding of land that would otherwise remain dry. This may take place for agricultural, military, or river-management purposes. For example, agricultural flooding may occur in preparing paddy fields for the growing of semi-aquatic rice in many countries.
        
        Flooding may occur as an overflow of water from water bodies, such as a river, lake, sea or ocean. In these cases, the water overtops or breaks levees, resulting in some of that water escaping its usual boundaries.[6] Flooding may also occur due to an accumulation of rainwater on saturated ground. This is called an areal flood. The size of a lake or other body of water naturally varies with seasonal changes in precipitation and snow melt. Those changes in size are however not considered a flood unless they flood property or drown domestic animals.
        
        Floods can also occur in rivers when the flow rate exceeds the capacity of the river channel, particularly at bends or meanders in the waterway. Floods often cause damage to homes and businesses if these buildings are in the natural flood plains of rivers. People could avoid riverine flood damage by moving away from rivers. However, people in many countries have traditionally lived and worked by rivers because the land is usually flat and fertile. Also, the rivers provide easy travel and access to commerce and industry.
        
        Flooding can damage property and also lead to secondary impacts. These include in the short term an increased spread of waterborne diseases and vector-bourne disesases, for example those diseases transmitted by mosquitos. Flooding can also lead to long-term displacement of residents.[7] Floods are an area of study of hydrology and hydraulic engineering.
        
        A large amount of the world's population lives in close proximity to major coastlines,[8] while many major cities and agricultural areas are located near floodplains.[9] There is significant risk for increased coastal and fluvial flooding due to changing climatic conditions.[10]</p></ul>

            INFORMATION ABOUT FLOODS
        </summary>

    <details><p>Floods affect more people globally than any other natural hazard. They can cause widespread devastation that can displace people, damage property and critical public infrastructure, and ultimately result in loss of life. And, as the planet continues to warm up due to climate change, the intensity and frequency of flooding is likely to increase.

        “Floods can destroy whole communities and cause billions of dollars of losses. So it’s vital that people, businesses and communities prepare for all flooding eventualities, especially as floods can impact areas located far from water sources,” says Amar Rahman, Global Head of Climate and Sustainability Solutions at Zurich Resilience Solutions.</p><ul>
            There are three common flood types: fluvial floods, also known as river floods; pluvial or flash floods; and coastal floods, which are often called storm surge. Each type of flood occurs and is forecast in different ways. The impacts of each type of flood are also different and so are the actions you need to take to avoid or minimize flooding damage.

Learn more about the three most common forms of flood:

Fluvial floods (river floods)
A fluvial, or river flood, occurs when the water level in a river, lake or stream rises and overflows onto the neighboring land. The water level rise of the river could be due to excessive rain or snowmelt.

        Flooding kills more people than just about any weather-related hazard. Most deaths associated with floods occur either at night, or when people become trapped in automobiles that stall while driving in areas that are flooded. Floods can be divided into two general categories: flash floods and river floods. Both hold potential for causing death, injury and property destruction.

Flash Floods

Most flash floods are caused by slow-moving thunderstorms, or thunderstorms which move over the same area one right after the other. Flash floods generally occur within a short time period after a rain event - generally 6 hours or less. For this reason they are more life threatening. Areas most susceptible to flash flooding are mountainous streams and rivers, urban areas, low-lying area, storm drains, and culverts.

River Floods

This type of flood is caused by a gradual increase in water level of a river or creek. These floods occur seasonally with general rains, or with torrential rains associated with tropical storms - such as the flooding which occurred in south Georgia after Tropical storm Alberto in 1994.

The National Weather Service will issue a Flood Watch / Flash Flood Watch when conditions are detected that could result in flooding/flash flooding of a certain area. Persons in the watch area are advised to keep informed and be ready to take action if a warning is issued or flooding is observed. A River Flood Warning, or a Flash Flood Warning will be issued when flooding/flash flooding is imminent in a specific location. Persons in the warned areas are advised to take precautions immediately.</ul>
